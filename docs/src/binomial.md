# Binomial options pricing model

#### Background
The binomial option pricing model is an options valuation method developed by [Cox et al in 1979](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0304405X79900151?via%3Dihub).
The binomial option pricing model uses an iterative procedure, allowing for the specification of nodes, or points in time, during the time span between the valuation date and the option's expiration date.
